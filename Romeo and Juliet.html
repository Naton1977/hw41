<h1><span style="color: darkslateblue">Romeo and Juliet</span> </h1>
<p><h3><span style="color : lightslategray"> ACT 1</span></h3>
<p><h3><span style="color:lightslategray">PROLOGUE</span></h3>
<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>
<p><h3><span style="color:lightslategray"> SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</span></h3>
<p><em><small>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</small></em></p>
<p><h4><span style="color:lightslategray">SAMPSON</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em"> Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</span></p>
<p><h4><span style="color:lightslategray"> GREGORY</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:1.1em ">No, for then we should be colliers.</span> </p>
